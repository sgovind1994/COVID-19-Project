## General Information
- While going through COVID-19 in the United States, it was a topic that was and still continues to affect my everyday life. So, thats what sparked my large interest
in this project, and motivated me to explore COVID case statistics in the United States. However, since this is a worldwide pandemic, I was also interested in exploring 
COVID-19 statistics in other countries around the world as well. As a general overview, I cleaned, sorted and analyzed the entire dataset, and based off these results,
decided to focus my analysis on three countries: Canada, India and Japan.
## Technologies Used
- R Studio
## Project Status

## Room for Improvement
-Rather than focus on my subconscious bias, I could have gone around that and focused my analysis on other countries than India, Japan and Canada.
